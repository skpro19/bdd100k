# What? 
This is a general set of guidelines for the Composer Agent. 


# Important Guidelines
* Try to actively use the terminal.
* Trying using the --verbose flag (when available) while installting stuff.
* Try to breakdown tasks in such a way that we can test them along the way. 
* Ask to test changes made at each step to the user.
* Refer [project.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project.mdc) for important project files.
* Follow PEP8 coding standard.
* Keep updating [tree.md](mdc:tree.md) at regular intervial using the "tree" command from the terminal. 
* Refer [tree.md](mdc:tree.md) to get a high-level overview of the project structure.


# General Guidelines
* Do not implement stuff unless explicitly asked for.
* Come up with detailed plans when asked for advice or suggestions.
* Try to add one feature at a time, test and verify it, and then move for the next one.
* While debugging issues, try to run the target script itself instead of asking the user.


# Coding Guidelines
* Try to actively use the terminal. 
* Try to test the changes at each step.
* Write detailed docstring for function
* Always use typehint when possible
* Use comments only when necessary
* Prefer using the logging module over the built-in print
